# Back to the Future : time-traveling through wikispeedia 

### Abstract 
After a few games of Wikispeedia, one can easily get discouraged: why is that game so difficult? Are you bad at the game or is the game too old for you? 
Our hypothesis is that those difficulties stem from the outdated structure of Wikipedia from 2007 used in the game. In this project, we thus explore how Wikipedia evolved between 2007 and now, 2024. To answer this, we compare the structure of the hyperlinks network between the two time points and also analyze how the 2024 version of Wikipedia would impact the paths of finished and unfinished games included in the dataset. Additionally, we analyze how a large language model (LLM) performs on the two different versions and see how this impacts the general performance of the game. This study sheds light on how Wikipedia's growth influences user navigation and may inform future adaptations of Wikispeedia to current Wikipedia structures.

### Research Questions : 
1. How did the Wikipedia structure change between 2004 and 2007? Is it better linked in 2024 than in 2007? 
2. How would this different structure impact the players? Would the target article be easier to reach from the source in 2024 compared to 2007? Is this also true for the unfinished paths?
3. Does an LLM perform better on 2007 or 2024 Wikipedia? 
4. Is the current structure more intuitive than the old one? Is it more specialized and less broad? Would that help when playing the game?
