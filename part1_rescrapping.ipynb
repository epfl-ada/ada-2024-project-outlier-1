    "In this part we investigate how Wikipedia evolved when compared to the 2007 version to the current one we use today. An interesting thought that occured to us was that the wikispeedia game was hard to play due to the not-so-up-to-date structure of the game. As players are using a restricted version from the 2007 Wikipedia data, this could also impact how the game is played. \n",
